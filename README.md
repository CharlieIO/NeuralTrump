# NeuralTrump

A simple script that attempts to utilize [larspars'](https://github.com/larspars) Word-based Recurrent Neural Network to generate Trump-esque tweets. Results are not too convincing as the amount of useable data is limited to the most recent 3200 tweets.

##Usage

All requirements for both [word-rnn](https://github.com/larspars/word-rnn) and [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) must be satisfied. **Change the file-locations on lines 72 and 74 to your respective directories, and be sure to update the Twitter credentials.**
